    <h1>Hexagonal heatmap</h1>

<p>
<b> Overplotting </b> is when the data or labels in a data visualization overlap, making it difficult to see individual data points in a data visualization.
</p>

<p>
If the amount of overplotting is low, you may be able to alleviate the problem by using smaller points, or by using a different shape (like shape 1, a hollow circle) through which other points can be seen.
</p>
<p>
If there’s a high degree of overplotting, there are a number of possible solutions:

Make the points semi-transparent
Bin the data into rectangles (better for quantitative analysis)
Bin the data into hexagons
Use box plots (when possible)
Jitter points
</p>

    In making these plots I spent approximately 0.1 euros using the Geocoding API of Google Maps. Though they currently give you a credit of 255 euros for 90 days, so I actually use the service for free. 


It's important to consider how many points are per hexagon (or bin). I there are very few the average may not be very informative (overfitting), if there are too much (and too few bins) you will not be able to see the differences.

ggplot’s stat_density2d, which uses MASS::kde2d on the backend to estimate the density using a bivariate normal kernel.

We have to be cautious with images with a lot of points, this one weights 1.9 MB
