    The objective was to make the introduction of a research project. The data had to exist but I didn't have to analyse it.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p style="background-color: #E6E9EB;">
    I measure how pass-through varies with competition in retail automotive fuel markets. 
    Using daily pricing data from gas stations in all the Spanish territory, I study how an unexpected and exogenous introduction of a 20 cents subsidy is passed through consumers in markets with different numbers of retailers. 
    I expect the pass-through to be lower in gas stations with low levels of competition.
