    The assignment consisted in writting a fake referee report for the following chosen paper:
    </p>
    <p class="highlight_p">
        Nathan Schiff, Jacob Cosman, Tianran Dai, Delivery in the city: 
        Differentiated products competition among New York restaurants, 
        Journal of Urban Economics, Volume 134, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2022.103509.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is a very interesting paper because it studies the response to entry in the restaurant sector in New York city  
    (a large market with differentiated products), 
    using a novel dataset and empirical strategy. 
    <br>
    They find that restaurants frequently adjust prices and product offerings 
    but they do not find evidence that restaurants respond differentially to new competition.
    <br>
    <br>
    Just as a note: In the restaurant market, restaurants compete not only in prices but also in the quality of their food or space and in advertising,
    and thus, we say it is a market with a monopolistic competition structure. It is very clear in this next picture (<a href="https://twitter.com/Wootenomics/status/1633996072010883074?s=20">from this tweet</a>) 
    that restaurants offer indeed differentiated products.
