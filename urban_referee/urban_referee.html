    <h1>Referee report for: <br>
        Delivery in the city: Differentiated products competition among New York restaurants <br>
        (Sam and Novosad 2020)</h1>
    <h2>Fake referee report for Urban Economics <br>
        (2on year, 2on term 2022)</h2>

    The assignment consisted in writting a fake referee report for the following chosen paper:

    <p class="highlight_p">
        Nathan Schiff, Jacob Cosman, Tianran Dai, Delivery in the city: 
        Differentiated products competition among New York restaurants, 
        Journal of Urban Economics, Volume 134, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2022.103509.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is a very interesting paper because it studies the response to entry in the restaurant market in New York city 
    using a novel dataset and empirical strategy. 
    In the restaurant market, restaurants compete not only in prices but also in the quality of their food and space and in advertising,
    thus, it is a market with monopolistic competition. 
    <br>
    It is very clear in this picture (<a href="https://twitter.com/Wootenomics/status/1633996072010883074?s=20">from this tweet</a>) 
    that restaurants offer differentiated product.
