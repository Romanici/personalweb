    The empirical strategy is based on the following paper for the US case: <br>
    Nguyen, Hoai-Luu Q. 2019. “Are Credit Markets Still Local? Evidence from Bank Branch Closings.” <br>
    American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 11(1): 1-32.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p style="background-color: #E6E9EB;">
    Over the past decade there have been a large number of bank mergers and mass layoffs in Spain due to the consolidation of the sector. 
In this paper, we first study the extent to which these two phenomena lead to the closure of bank branches, and then we examine the repercussions of these closures on economic activity at the municipal level, particularly on the number of employment contracts signed. 
To do the latter, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the incidence of closings caused by the exposure to post-merger branch consolidation and to mass layoffs. 
The results show that merger activity leads to an increase in closures, but the effects of these closures on economic activity remain unclear.
