    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p style="background-color: #E6E9EB;">
        In this section I will replicate the main tables and plots from the paper and I will comment on them.
        The replication will not focus much on the economic theory or data preprocessing, but on evaluating
        carefully the empirical design. I will analyze the underlying assumptions in detail and I will test
        them, providing the necessary robustness checks. As an extension of the paper, I will develop some
        methodological points that I think are not discussed enough in the paper.
